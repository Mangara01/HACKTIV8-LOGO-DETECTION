# Real Fake Logo Detection

## Background

In today's digital era, logos are very important because they represent a particular brand or company and have high commercial value. Therefore, the ability to automatically recognize and predict logos in a dataset can have many practical benefits.

With the ability to predict the logo-image, several applications that can be realized include: Brand Identification, Brand Monitoring, Copyright Protection, Visual Search.

With the ability to predict logos in a dataset, this goal will enable the development of practical solutions for the above applications. Through the application of machine learning and image processing techniques, it is hoped that the developed system can provide accurate predictive results and assist in various business and technological contexts.

## Objective

Predicting logo image from the given dataset.

## Key Feature

* Logo Detection: The CNN-based model can detect logos within images and provide information on their authenticity.
* Binary Classification: It classifies logos as either real or fake, making it a valuable tool for brand protection.
* Customizable: You can fine-tune the model on your specific logo dataset or use a pre-trained model for faster deployment.
* Scalable: The model can be used with different types of logos, making it versatile for various industries.
